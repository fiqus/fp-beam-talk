# HexDocs

HexDocs is a place for Erlang/Elixir packages to host their documentation at https://hexdocs.pm  
The documentation is automatically published when you publish your package with `mix hex.publish`

!code code/hexdocs.exs

# Mix

Mix is a build tool that ships with Elixir that provides tasks for creating apps, compiling, releasing, testing, dependencies management and much more.  
It relies in the `mix.exs` file that defines all the project properties, including its dependencies.  
The file `mix.lock` will hold the freezed dependencies versions that can be upgraded with `mix deps.update`.

* Display help: `mix help` or `mix help deps.update` for a specific task
* Create a new project skeleton: `mix new my_project`
* Getting project dependencies: `mix deps.get`
* Compile project: `mix compile`
* Running tests: `mix test`
* Formatting the code: `mix format`
* Generating a release package: `mix release`
* Publish your code at hex.pm: `mix hex.publish`
* Start a Phoenix server: `mix phx.server` or `iex -S mix phx.server` for _interactive_ mode
